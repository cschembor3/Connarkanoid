CONNARKANOID

To start Connarkanoid, press START at the start screen. You will then enter the game screen.

You can move around the bar with the arrow keys, and release the ball using the A button when ready.
Try your best to keep the ball from getting past the bar, and try to break all the bricks.

Look out for Power-Ups! 
If you break a brick that contains a power-up, the power-up will appear where the brick was. Hit this with the ball, and you will get a power-up!
Power-ups increase your score multiplier, so you will want to get them in order to get a high score!

To restart the game at any point, simply press SELECT. This will bring you back to the start screen, where you can restart and play again!
